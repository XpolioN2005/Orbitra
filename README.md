# Orbitra: Bullet Symphony

**A 2D Boss-Rush Bullet Hell Prototype**  
Developed by [XpolioN](https://xpolion.itch.io/)

---

## 🎮 Overview
**Orbitra: Bullet Symphony** traps you in the gravitational pull of colossal bosses.  
Your only way to survive? Orbit, dodge, and strike in perfect rhythm.  

This prototype explores the **core orbital combat system** — movement, bullet patterns, and the tension of being locked in constant motion.  

> “Every orbit is a dance with death. Every boss, a symphony of chaos.”
